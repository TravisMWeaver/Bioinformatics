For the human-mouse protein comparison program, the following BLAST settings and options were utilized in order to achieve the results desired.

1. The "blastp" program was used because the goal was to compare human protein sequences to mouse protein sequences. It is also supported by "qblast", making it a good option for my needs.

2. The "nr" database option was used because it supports protein sequences from multiple content sources

3. The BLOSUM 62 substitution matrix was used because it is excellent at comparing evolutionary diversity (especially over a long period of time)

4. A "hitlist_size" of 1 was used because I was only interested in finding the most comparatively, close protein
